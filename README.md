# SarVam-Cipher-Algorithm

_This Cryptic Algorithm was created by me as my 3rd year College Project.
For the Course Information Security._


I have created it as a header file, you can directly use it by using :

**#include "SarVam_Cipher.h"**


## Drawbacks
* It can only be used for messages upto 89 characters.
* It generates a long cipher text from using numbers from 1-9.

# Advantages
* Needs approx. 25! Brute force tries.
* Best for Password Encryption.
